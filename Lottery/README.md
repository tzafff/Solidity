# Lottery Smart Contract

The Lottery smart contract is a simple Ethereum-based application that allows participants to join a lottery by sending a specific amount of Ether. The contract randomly selects a winner among the participants, and the winner receives the total Ether balance in the contract.

## Contract Features

### Manager

- The contract has a manager who is the address that deployed the contract.

### Participants

- Participants can join the lottery by sending a specific amount of Ether (10 wei) to the contract.

### Winner Selection

- The contract selects a random winner among the participants.

### Prize Distribution

- The winner receives the total Ether balance in the contract.

## Usage

1. **Deploy the Contract**:

   - Deploy the Lottery contract, and the deploying address becomes the manager.

2. **Participate in the Lottery**:

   - Participants can join the lottery by calling the `participate` function and sending 10 wei with the transaction.

3. **Check Contract Balance**:

   - The manager can check the contract's balance by calling the `getBalance` function.

4. **Pick a Winner**:

   - The manager can pick a winner by calling the `pickWinner` function when there are at least 3 participants. The contract randomly selects a winner and transfers the total contract balance to them.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure the contract is deployed on a secure and well-audited blockchain.
- Participants should be aware of the rules and requirements for joining the lottery.
- The manager should not abuse their authority and should only pick a winner when there are enough participants.

## Functions and Data

- `participate`: Allows participants to join the lottery by sending 10 wei.
- `getBalance`: Allows the manager to check the contract's balance.
- `random`: Generates a pseudo-random number based on block data.
- `pickWinner`: Allows the manager to select a random winner and distribute the prize.

This contract provides a basic example of a lottery application on the Ethereum blockchain. It's important to use it responsibly and ensure fairness in selecting winners.
