# MultiSigWallet Smart Contract

This is a Multi-Signature Wallet smart contract implemented in Solidity. Multi-signature wallets are commonly used in blockchain applications to require multiple parties (owners) to approve and execute transactions, adding an extra layer of security.

## Contract Features

### Owners

- The contract allows you to specify a list of owners who have the authority to confirm and execute transactions.

### Confirmation Requirement

- You can set a requirement for the number of confirmations required from the owners before a transaction can be executed.

### Transaction Submission

- Owners can submit transactions to the wallet by specifying the recipient address and amount.

### Transaction Confirmation

- Owners can confirm transactions submitted by other owners.

### Transaction Execution

- Once the required number of confirmations is reached, any owner can execute the transaction.

## Events

The contract emits events to provide transparency and tracking:

- `TransactionSubmitted`: When a transaction is submitted.
- `TransactionConfirmed`: When a transaction is confirmed by an owner.
- `TransactionExecuted`: When a transaction is successfully executed.

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the contract on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
2. Specify the list of owners and the required number of confirmations in the constructor.
3. Owners can submit transactions, confirm them, and execute them as needed.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure the contract is deployed on a secure and well-audited blockchain.
- Review and test the contract thoroughly before using it with real funds.
- Be cautious when specifying the list of owners and the confirmation requirement to avoid unintended transactions.
