# Solidity Smart Contracts Repository

Welcome to the Solidity Smart Contracts Repository! This repository contains a collection of Ethereum-based smart contracts written in Solidity, each designed for specific purposes. Below, you will find a brief description of each project within this repository.

## Projects

### 1. MultiSigWallet

The `MultiSigWallet` smart contract is designed to facilitate multi-signature wallets on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows multiple owners to manage and approve transactions, enhancing security and control over wallet operations. This contract is useful for scenarios where multiple parties need to collaborate on fund management.

- Features: Multi-owner management, transaction submission, confirmation, and execution.
- Usage: Deploy the contract with a list of owners and set the required confirmation threshold for transactions.

### 2. EventContract

The `EventContract` smart contract is created for managing and selling tickets for events on the Ethereum blockchain. It offers functionalities to create events, purchase tickets, and transfer tickets between addresses, simplifying the management of event-related activities.

- Features: Event creation, ticket purchase, and ticket transfer.
- Usage: Create events with event details, purchase tickets for events, and transfer tickets to other addresses.

### 3. Lottery

The `Lottery` smart contract is a simple lottery application where participants can join the lottery by sending a specific amount of Ether. The contract randomly selects a winner among the participants, and the winner receives the total Ether balance in the contract.

- Features: Participant registration, winner selection, and prize distribution.
- Usage: Deploy the contract, let participants join the lottery, and select a winner when there are enough participants.
