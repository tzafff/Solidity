# CrowdFunding Smart Contract

The CrowdFunding smart contract is designed to facilitate crowdfunding campaigns on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows project managers to create funding requests, contributors to contribute to campaigns, and project managers to execute requests once a funding goal is reached. Below, you'll find details about the contract and its features.

## Contract Features

### Campaign Creation

- Project managers can create crowdfunding campaigns by specifying a funding target and a deadline for the campaign.

### Contribution

- Contributors can contribute to campaigns by sending Ether. Contributions are tracked and recorded by the contract.

### Request Creation

- Project managers can create funding requests to spend the contributed Ether on specific purposes related to the campaign.

### Request Approval

- Contributors can vote on funding requests. Once a request receives majority support from contributors, the project manager can execute it.

### Refund

- Contributors can request a refund if the campaign deadline passes, and the funding target is not met.

## Contract Data

- `requests`: A mapping of campaign requests, including their descriptions, recipients, values, completion status, and voter information.
- `contributors`: A mapping of contributors and their contributions.
- `numRequests`: The number of funding requests.
- `manager`: The address of the campaign manager.
- `minimumContribution`: The minimum contribution amount required.
- `deadline`: The deadline for the campaign.
- `target`: The funding target for the campaign.
- `raisedAmount`: The total amount of Ether raised.
- `noOfContributors`: The number of contributors.

## Usage

1. **Create a Campaign**:

   - Deploy the `CrowdFunding` contract, specifying the funding target and deadline.

2. **Contribute to a Campaign**:

   - Contributors can send Ether to the contract address to contribute to the campaign. Contributions are tracked.

3. **Create Funding Requests**:

   - Project managers can create funding requests, specifying a description, recipient address, and value.

4. **Vote on Requests**:

   - Contributors can vote on funding requests to approve or reject them.

5. **Refund**:

   - Contributors can request a refund if the campaign deadline passes without meeting the funding target.

6. **Make Payments**:

   - Once the funding target is met and a request receives majority approval, project managers can execute the request to make payments to recipients.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure the contract is deployed on a secure and well-audited blockchain.
- Review and test the contract thoroughly before using it in production environments.
- Be cautious about setting campaign parameters, as they affect campaign behavior.
